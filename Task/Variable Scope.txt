Question 1
What is Variable Scope
A scope in Javascript refers to the current context of code that determines the accesibility of variables to Javascript.
A variable scope is therefore the scope in which a variable is accessible to Javascript.
There are two types of Scope
Local Variable Scope(declared within a block) and
Global Variable Scope(declared outside a block).

Question 2
How is the let keyword different from var.
The two keywords let and var are both used to declare variables in Javascript but var is a function scope while let is a block scope.
This means that let is accessible within a block of code whila var is only accesible within a function.
The var keyword are always function-scoped. This means that they recognize functions as having a seperate scope.
but the let keyword is block-scoped which means a new local scope is created from any kind of blocks including function blocks.
Other kinds of blocks are if/else, for and while loops.
