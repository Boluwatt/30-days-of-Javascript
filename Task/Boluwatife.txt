Hello, my name is Boluwatife Oluwagbamila.
I'm a student of FemCode Africa in the 30 days of JavaScript class.
This is my first task for the class.
This is a simple text file to be pushed to my github repo.
At the end of this class, I hope to be a more proficient developer.
I also hope to be among the five students to win a continued mentorship.
That is why I am going to put in my best.
Thank you.
