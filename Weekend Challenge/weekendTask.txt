Question 1.  What is the difference between null and undefined?

Null is an empty variable while undefined is used for a variable that is declared but has not
been assigned. Null is an assignment value. It can be assigned to a variable as a representation 
of no value. Basically null value means a variable has been explicitly set as no value/null 
or has been initialized and defined to be nothing. While undefined means it was never initialized 
or if it was, it was never assigned a value or defined.
